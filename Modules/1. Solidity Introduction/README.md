# 🌟 Solidity Introduction - Module 1 🚀

Welcome to Module 1 of our journey through the **Learn Solidity** course on Alchemy! This module is all about getting our feet wet with Solidity, the smart contract programming language that powers the Ethereum blockchain. Let's dive in and explore the basics!

## Module Overview

In this module, we tackled the fundamentals of Solidity. We learned about its syntax, data types, and basic structures. This foundation is crucial as it sets the stage for more advanced topics in later modules.

## What We Learned

### 📚 Basics of Solidity
- **What is Solidity?** Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts on Ethereum. It's influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.
- **Setting up the Environment:** We installed the essential tools, including Remix IDE, to write and test our smart contracts.

### 🛠 Writing Our First Contract
- **Simple Storage Contract:** We wrote a basic contract to store and retrieve a value. This helped us understand the structure of a Solidity contract, including state variables, functions, and the `public` keyword.

### 🔍 Key Concepts
- **State Variables and Functions:** We learned how to declare and manipulate state variables, and how to define functions that can modify and read these variables.
- **Visibility Specifiers:** Understanding `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external` to control access to contract functions and variables.
- **Data Types:** An overview of basic data types in Solidity such as `uint`, `int`, `bool`, `address`, and more.
- **Events:** Learning how to use events to log information to the blockchain, which can be useful for debugging and external communication.
- **Modifiers:** Using modifiers to change the behavior of functions, such as adding access restrictions.
